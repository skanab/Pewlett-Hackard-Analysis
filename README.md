## Silver Tsunami threatens to wipe Pewlett off the map.

Pewlett Hachard has hired Bobby to deploy an early Silver Tsunami warning system. He has created a database with its employee data that has detected some significant issues facing the company.

## Amplitude of the Silver Tsunami

Thirty percent,90,398, of Pewlett's employees between the ages of 65 and 68 are ready to retire. This potential senior talent drain is a real threat to Pewlett's business.

One thousand five hundred forty-nine employees aged 55 have been identified as potential mentors to train new hires. 

## Pewlett must get to high ground and reinforce the current workforce to survive the Silver Tsunami.

Pwelett's has identified a minimal scope of potential mentors. Pewlett's Human Capital Management system data should be imported into the database to make decisions based on performance, accomplishments, and desired career path and not just age. This data would allow Pwelett to widen the mentor pool.

Not only do they need to identify potential mentors, but they also need to identify current employees that can be mentored. Bobby should run a query to find employees ages 25 to 35 to identify current employees that can be mentored.
